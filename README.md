# mock_services
Creates mock services from a json file using NodeJS

A) Endpoints are kept as JSON in endpoints.json. I've included an example endpoint in the project. Data must be JSON format.

B) Run the generator with 'node index.js' command inside the directory. This starts a server at http://localhost:3000/.
